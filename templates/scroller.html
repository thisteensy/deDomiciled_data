        <div class="title">The deDomiciled Project</div>
        Welcome to the deDomiciled Project<br/><br/>An exploration of data regarding unhoused citizens.
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">About</div>
        The original idea of this project was to explore the changes in the number of unhoused people in each state over time.<br/><br/>

      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">My Talk</div>
        Using available Point in Time counts of unhoused people, I created this map.<br/>
        As we progress from 2011 to 2019 you can see how some states improve and some states get worse.<br/>
        You can hover over the states to see the exact numbers of unhoused people per 100,000 residents.

        <div class="title">My Stumbles</div>
        And here are all the fillers I used in those 30 minutes.
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">Um's, Ah's &amp; Uh's</div>
        I almost exclusively used these three fillers. Um's and Ah's made up over 80%, with Uh's trailing behind.
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">Fillers Over Time</div>
        I hoped that all these blunders were toward the beginning of my talk. And the data suggests that fewer fillers are used as I get into it. Perhaps the talk started out rough and improved as I found my groove.
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">Ramping Back Up</div>
        Unfortunately, the trend does not continue. Midway into the talk my Um's and Ah's spike. I continue to use them pretty consistently throughout the rest of the talk.
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">The Cough Effect</div>
        My theory is that at this critical halfway point in my talk, I heard a dry cough indicative of the audience's waning interest. This caused self-confidence to collapse and forced me out of my groove.<br/><br/>A competing theory is that I just hadn't practiced the last half of my speech as much.

      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">Best of Luck to Me in 2015</div>
        The world may never know, or care, but hopefully these insights improve my speaking in 2015. Though preliminary results aren't looking so good.
