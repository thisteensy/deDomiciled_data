        <div class="title">About</div>
        The original idea of this project was to explore the changes in the number of unhoused people in each state over time.<br/><br/>

      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">The Map</div>
        Using available Point in Time counts of unhoused people from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development, I created this map.<br/>
        As we progress from 2011 to 2019 you can see how some states improve and some states get worse.<br/>
        You can hover over the states to see the exact numbers of unhoused people per 100,000 residents.<br/>
        Pay attention to Lousiana. They went from having one of the counts per 100,000 after Hurricaine Katrina to one of the lowest.<br/>
        This is because in 2011 they implemented the Housing First approach. By 2019 they had cut their number of unhoused people by more than 80%

        <div class="title">The Chart</div>
        After creating the map I wanted to look at how different factors interacted with houselessness.
        With this chart you can choose a state and the type of data you want to look at.
        With the percent change over time feature you can see that in states where availability of low-cost housing was falling faster than poverty houselessness increases.
      </section>
      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">The Future</div>
        In the future I would like to explore other factors that contribute to houselessness, like investment in mental health services.<br/>
        This data was not available at the current time, but I hope to be able to obtain this for a future release.<br/>
        It would also be interesting to zoom in on smaller geographic areas, but it was difficult due to inconsistent partitioning of geographic areas across data sources.

        <div class="title">Thank you</div>
        Thank you for your interest in my project. I hope this visualization helped increase your interest in the crisis of houselessness.
