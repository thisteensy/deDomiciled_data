## Project Proposal

### Overview

![](/images/index.png)

deDomiciled Data was created to offer a way to view the problem of houselessness as a systemic social issue by correlating data about the unhoused population in the United States with other related data. It combines data from the Dept. of Housing and Urban Development and US Census Bureau to create two features: 

a map

and a chart

both of which are rendered using the d3 Javascript library. The animated map colorfully illustrates the change in the unhoused population over time. It has a mouseover feature which reveals count data in individual states, and clickable states which lead to the chart feature. The chart allows a choice of state and the type of data to view, and has a tooltip, which reveals exact y-axis numbers on mouseover.
