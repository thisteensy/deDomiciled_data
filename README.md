## Project Proposal

### Overview

This project will correlate data about the unhoused population in the United States and offer users different ways of interacting with that data on a map.

### Technologies required (besides typical Hackbright tech stack)

- List any APIs or data sources you're planning on using here

### Data

- HUD PIT count data
- US Census count
- Low Income Rental Housing Inventory data
- Per Capital State Spending on Mental Health Services

### Roadmap

#### MVP

- Display map of the US with each state linked to a detail page with the most current available year's data
- Multiple maps for each type of data, with choice of year to display
- color banding to indicate state performance according to data

#### 2.0

- choice of data year for each map/state detail page
- Data analysis of changes over time for available data years

#### 3.0

- year slider on each map
- mouseover for each state's data for chosen year
